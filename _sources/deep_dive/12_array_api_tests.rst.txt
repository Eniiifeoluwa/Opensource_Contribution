All functions which are present in the `Array API Standard`_ have a corresponding unit test in the
`test suite`_ for the standard.

The test suite is included in the ivy repository as a submodule in the folder `test_array_api`_,
which we keep updated with the upstream test suite.

The entire test suite is run independently `for each backend`_ on every push to the repo.
Therefore, every function which exists in the standard is thoroughly tested for
adherence to the standard on a continuous basis.

You will need to make sure the Array API tests are passing for each backend framework if/when making any changes to Ivy
functions which are part of the standard.

**Round Up**

This should have hopefully given you a good understanding of how the Array API test suite is used for testing Ivy.

If you're ever unsure of how best to proceed,
please feel free to engage with the `array api tests discussion`_,
or reach out on `discord`_ in the `array api tests channel`_!
