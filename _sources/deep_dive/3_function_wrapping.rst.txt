When a backend framework is set by calling :code:`ivy.set_backend(backend_name)`,
then all Ivy functions are `wrapped`_. This is achieved by calling `_wrap_or_unwrap_functions`_,
with :code:`_wrap_function` as an argument.
:code:`_wrap_or_unwrap_functions` is then called recursively,
and :code:`_wrap_function` is called on each function `at the leaves`_ of the ivy module,
with the returned function replacing the original function.

The new function returned by :code:`_wrap_function` (:code:`_function_wrapped`)
is a replacement of the original function with extra code added to support requirements common to many functions
in the API. This is the main purpose of the wrapping, to avoid code duplication which would exist if we added
identical logic in every single function independenly.

Depending on the function being wrapped, the new function :code:`_function_wrapped`
might handle :ref:`Arrays`, :ref:`Inplace Updates`, :ref:`Data Types` and/or :ref:`Devices`.

Each of these topics and each associated piece of logic added by :code:`_wrap_function` are covered in more detail
in the next sections. For now, suffice it to say that :code:`_wrap_function` `does a quite lot`_.

**Round Up**

This should have hopefully given you a good feel for how function wrapping is applied to functions in Ivy.

If you're ever unsure of how best to proceed,
please feel free to engage with the `function wrapping discussion`_,
or reach out on `discord`_ in the `function wrapping channel`_!
