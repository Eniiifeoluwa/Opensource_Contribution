The `ivy.Container`_ inherits from `dict`_, and is useful for storing nested data.
For example, the container is equally suitable for storing batches of training data,
or for storing the weights of a network.

The methods of the :code:`ivy.Container` class are more varied than those of the :code:`ivy.Array`.
All methods of the :code:`ivy.Array` are instance methods,
and almost all of them directly wrap a function in the functional API.

For the :code:`ivy.Container`, there are also methods which are specific to the container itself,
for performing nested operations on the leaves of the container for example.
In addition, there are also static methods.
Overall, this results in the following five mutually exclusive groups of :code:`ivy.Container` methods.
Each of these are explained in the following sub-sections.

#. Container instance methods
#. Container static methods
#. API instance methods
#. API special methods
#. API static methods

Container Instance Methods
--------------------------

Container instance methods are methods which are specific to the container itself.
A few examples include `ivy.Container.map`_ which is used for mapping a function to all leaves of the container,
`ivy.Container.all_true`_ which determines if all container leaves evaluate to boolean `True`,
and `ivy.Container.to_iterator`_ which returns an iterator for traversing the leaves of the container.

There are many more examples, check out the abstract `ContainerBase`_ class to see some more!

Container Static Methods
------------------------

Container static methods are also methods which are specific to containers,
but which generally operate across *multiple* containers rather than a single container.
This underpins the decision to not bind these method to a single container instance,
and instead implement them as *static* methods.

A few examples include `ivy.Container.multi_map`_
which is used for mapping a function to all leaves of *multiple* containers with the same nested structure,
`ivy.Container.diff`_ which displays the difference in nested structure between multiple containers,
and `ivy.Container.common_key_chains`_ which returns the nested structure that is common to all containers.

There are many more examples, check out the abstract `ContainerBase`_ class to see some more!

API Static Methods
------------------

Unlike the :code:`ivy.Array` class, the :code:`ivy.Container` also implements all functions in the functional API as
*static* methods. The main reason for this is to support the *nestable* property of all functions in the API,
which is explained in detail in the :ref:`Function Types` section.

To recap, what this means is that every function can arbitrarily accept :code:`ivy.Container` instances for **any**
of the arguments, and in such cases the function will automatically be mapped to the leaves of this container.
When multiple containers are passed, this mapping is only applied to their shared nested structure,
with the mapping applied to each of these leaves.

In such cases, the function in the functional API defers to this *static* :code:`ivy.Container` implementation.
Under the hood, `ivy.Container.multi_map_in_static_method`_ enables us to pass in arbitrary combinations of containers
and non-containers, and perform the correct mapping across the leaves.
Internally, :code:`ivy.Container.multi_map_in_static_method` calls `ivy.Container.multi_map`_.
In cases where there are no containers passed,
`ivy.Container.multi_map_in_static_method`_ will simply call the function once on the non-container arguments provided.

A few examples of :code:`ivy.Container` API static methods are
`ivy.Container.static_add`_, `ivy.Container.static_tan`_ and `ivy.Container.static_roll`_.

As with :code:`ivy.Array`,
given the simple set of rules which underpin how these static methods should all be implemented,
if a source-code implementation is not found,
then this `static method is added`_ programmatically.
This serves as a helpful backup in cases where some static methods are accidentally missed out.

The benefit of the source code implementations is that this makes the code much more readable,
with important methods not being entirely absent from the code.
It also enables other helpful perks, such as auto-completions in the IDE etc.

API Instance Methods
--------------------

The *API* instance methods serve a similar purpose to the instance methods of the :code:`ivy.Array` class.
They enable functions in Ivy's functional API to be called as instance methods on the :code:`ivy.Container` class.
The difference is that with the :code:`ivy.Container`,
the API function is applied recursively to all the leaves of the container.

Under the hood, every *instance* method calls the corresponding *static* method.
For example, `ivy.Container.add`_ calls :code:`ivy.Container.static_add`,
`ivy.Container.tan`_ calls :code:`ivy.Container.static_tan`,
and `ivy.Container.roll`_ calls :code:`ivy.Container.static_roll`.

As is the case for :code:`ivy.Array`,
the organization of these instance methods follows the same organizational structure as the
files in the functional API.
The :code:`ivy.Container` class `inherits`_ from many category-specific array classes,
such as `ContainerWithElementwise`_, each of which implement the category-specific instance methods.

Again, as with :code:`ivy.Array`,
given the simple set of rules which underpin how these instance methods should all be implemented,
if a source-code implementation is not found,
then this `instance method is added`_ programmatically.
Again, this serves as a helpful backup in cases where some static methods are accidentally missed out.

Again, the benefit of the source code implementations is that this makes the code much more readable,
with important methods not being entirely absent from the code.
It also enables other helpful perks, such as auto-completions in the IDE etc.

API Special Methods
--------------------

As is the case for the :code:`ivy.Array`,
most special methods of the :code:`ivy.Container` simply wrap a corresponding function in the functional API.

The special methods which **do not** wrap functions in the functional API are implemented in `ContainerBase`_,
which is the base abstract class for all containers.
These special methods include
`__repr__`_ which controls how the container is printed in the terminal,
`__getattr__`_ that enables keys in the underlying :code:`dict` to be queried as attributes,
`__setattr__`_ that enables attribute setting to update the underlying :code:`dict`,
`__getitem__`_ that enables the underlying :code:`dict` to be queried via a chain of keys,
`__setitem__`_ that enables the underlying :code:`dict` to be set via a chain of keys,
`__contains__`_ that enables us to check for chains of keys in the underlying :code:`dict`,
and `__getstate__`_ and `__setstate__`_ which combined enable the container to be pickled and unpickled.

As for the special methods which **do** simply wrap corresponding functions in the functional API,
these are `implemented`_ in the main :code:`ivy.Container` class.

These special methods all directly wrap the corresponding API *static* :code:`ivy.Container` method.

Examples include `__add__`_, `__sub__`_, `__mul__`_ and `__truediv__`_ which directly call
:code:`ivy.Container.static_add`, :code:`ivy.Container.static_subtract`,
:code:`ivy.Container.static_multiply` and :code:`ivy.Container.static_divide` respectively.

Nestable Functions
------------------

As introduced in the :ref:`Function Types` section, most functions in Ivy are
*nestable*, which means that they can accept :code:`ivy.Container` instances in place
of **any** of the arguments.

Here, we expand on this explanation.
Please check out the explanation in the :ref:`Function Types` section first.

**Shared Nested Structure**

NOTE - implementing the behaviour for shared nested structures is a work in progress,
the master branch will soon support all of the examples given below, but not yet 🚧

When the nested structures of the multiple containers are *shared* but not *identical*,
then the behaviour of the nestable function is a bit different.
Containers have *shared* nested structures if all unique leaves in any of the containers
are children of a nested structure which is shared by all other containers.

Take the example below, the nested structures of containers :code:`x` and :code:`y`
are shared but not identical.

.. code-block:: python

    x = ivy.Container(a={'b': 2, 'c': 4}, d={'e': 6, 'f': 8})
    y = ivy.Container(a=2, d=3)

The shared key chains (chains of keys, used for indexing the container)
are :code:`a` and :code:`d`. The key chains unique to :code:`x` are :code:`a/b`, :code:`a/c`,
:code:`d/e` and :code:`d/f`. The unique key chains all share the same base structure as
all other containers (in this case only one other container, :code:`y`).
Therefore, the containers :code:`x` and :code:`y` have shared nested structure.

When calling *nestable* functions on containers with non-identical structure,
then the shared leaves of the shallowest container are broadcast to the leaves of the
deepest container.

It's helpful to look at an example:

.. code-block:: python

    print(x / y)
    {
        a: {
          b: 1,
          c: 2
        },
        d: {
          e: 3,
          f: 2.67
        }
    }

In this case, the integer at :code:`y.a` is broadcast to the leaves :code:`x.a.b` and
:code:`x.a.c`, and the integer at :code:`y.d` is broadcast to the leaves :code:`x.d.e`
and :code:`x.d.f`.

Another example of containers with shared nested structure is given below:

.. code-block:: python

    x = ivy.Container(a={'b': 2, 'c': 4}, d={'e': 6, 'f': 8})
    y = ivy.Container(a=2, d=3)
    z = ivy.Container(a={'b': 10, 'c': {'g': 11, 'h': 12}}, d={'e': 13, 'f': 14})

Adding these containers together would result in the following:

.. code-block:: python

    print(x + y + z)
    {
        a: {
          b: 14,
          c: {
            g: 17,
            h: 18,
          }
        },
        d: {
          e: 22,
          f: 25
        }
    }

An example of containers which **do not** have shared nested structure is given below:

.. code-block:: python

    x = ivy.Container(a={'b': 2, 'c': 4}, d={'e': 6, 'f': 8})
    y = ivy.Container(a=2, d=3, g=4)
    z = ivy.Container(a={'b': 10, 'c': {'g': 11, 'h': 12}}, d={'e': 13, 'g': 14})

This is for three reasons, (a) the key chain :code:`g` is not shared by any container other
than :code:`y`, (b) the key chain :code:`d/f` for :code:`x` is not present in
:code:`z` despite :code:`d` not being a non-leaf node in :code:`z`,
and likewise the key chain :code:`d/g` for :code:`z` is not present in :code:`x`
despite :code:`d` not being a non-leaf node in :code:`x`.

**Container-dependent Functions**

*Container-dependent* functions are functions containing arguments which, if provided,
**must** be provided as an :code:`ivy.Container`.
*Container-dependent* functions are never *nestable*, as we will explain.
Due to their dependence on containers, *container-dependent* functions all have a natural
many (the containers) to one (all other arguments) correspondence in the arguments,
unlike *nestable* functions which have a one-to-one correspondence between the arguments
by default.

A couple of examples of *Container-dependent* functions are:
:code:`ivy.execute_with_gradients` and :code:`ivy.multi_head_attention`.

We'll go through the signatures and docstring descriptions for both of these in turn.

.. code-block:: python

    def execute_with_gradients(
        func: Callable,
        xs: ivy.Container,
        retain_grads: bool = False,
    ) -> Tuple[ivy.Array, ivy.Container, Any]:
        """
        Call function func with container of input variables xs, and return the
        functions first output y, the gradients dy/dx as a new container, and any other
        function outputs after the returned y value.
        """

Technically, this function *could* be made fully nestable, whereby the function would
be independently applied on each leaf node of the :code:`ivy.Container` of variables,
but this would be much less efficient, with the backend autograd function
(such as :code:`torch.autograd.grad`) being called many times independently for each
variable in the container of variables :code:`xs`. By making this function non-nestable,
we do not map the function across each of the container leaves, and instead pass the
entire container into the backend autograd function directly,
which is much more efficient.

If the function were *nestable*, it would also repeatedly return :code:`y` and all
other function return values at each leaf of the single returned container,
changing the signature of the function, and causing repeated redundancy in the return.

The example :code:`ivy.multi_head_attention` is a bit different.

.. code-block:: python

    def multi_head_attention(
        x: Union[ivy.Array, ivy.NativeArray],
        scale: Number,
        num_heads: int,
        context: Optional[Union[ivy.Array, ivy.NativeArray]] = None,
        mask: Optional[Union[ivy.Array, ivy.NativeArray]] = None,
        to_q_fn: Optional[Callable] = None,
        to_kv_fn: Optional[Callable] = None,
        to_out_fn: Optional[Callable] = None,
        to_q_v: Optional[ivy.Container] = None,
        to_kv_v: Optional[ivy.Container] = None,
        to_out_v: Optional[ivy.Container] = None,
        out: Optional[ivy.Array] = None,
    ) -> ivy.Array:
        """
        Applies multi-head attention, with the array (x) to determine the queries from,
        the scale for the query-key similarity measure, the number of
        attention heads, the context to determine the keys and values from,
        the mask to apply to the query-key values, the function (to_q_fn) to compute
        queries from input x, the function (to_kv_fn) to compute keys and values from
        the context, the function (to_out_fn) to compute the output from the scaled
        dot-product attention, the variables (to_q_v) for function to_q_fn, the
        variables (to_kv_v) for function to_kv_fn, and the variables (to_out_v) for
        function to_out_fn.
        """

This function fundamentally could not be made *nestable*,
as the function takes a many-to-one approach with regards to the optional containers:
:code:`to_q_v`, :code:`to_kv_v` and :code:`to_out_v`.
The containers are optionally used for the purpose of returning a single
:code:`ivy.Array` at the end. Calling this function on each leaf of the containers
passed in the input would not make any sense.

Hopefully, these two examples explain why *Container-dependent* functions
(with arguments which, if provided, **must** be provided as an :code:`ivy.Container`),
are never implemented as *nestable* functions.

**Implicitly Nestable Functions**

The *nestable* behaviour is added to any function which is decorated with the
`handle_nestable <https://github.com/unifyai/ivy/blob/5f58c087906a797b5cb5603714d5e5a532fc4cd4/ivy/func_wrapper.py#L407>`_
wrapper. This wrapper causes the function to be applied at each leaf of any containers
passed in the input. For *compositional* functions which are composed of other nestable
functions, then this compositional function is already **implicitly nestable**,
without us needing to explicitly wrap it at all.

Let's take the function :code:`ivy.cross_entropy` as an example.
The internally called functions are: :code:`ivy.clip`, :code:`ivy.log`, :code:`ivy.sum`
and :code:`ivy.negative`, each of which are themselves *nestable*.

.. code-block:: python

    def cross_entropy(
        true: Union[ivy.Array, ivy.NativeArray],
        pred: Union[ivy.Array, ivy.NativeArray],
        axis: Optional[int] = -1,
        epsilon: Optional[float] = 1e-7,
        *,
        out: Optional[ivy.Array] = None
    ) -> ivy.Array:
        pred = ivy.clip(pred, epsilon, 1 - epsilon)
        log_pred = ivy.log(pred)
        return ivy.negative(ivy.sum(log_pred * true, axis, out=out), out=out)

Therefore, when passing an :code:`ivy.Container` instance in the input,
each internal function will, in turn, correctly handle the container, and return
a new container with the correct operations having been performed. This makes it very
easy and intuitive to debug the code, as the code is stepped through chronologically.
In effect, all leaves of the input container are being processed concurrently,
during the computation steps of the :code:`ivy.cross_entropy` function.

However, what if we had added the
`handle_nestable <https://github.com/unifyai/ivy/blob/5f58c087906a797b5cb5603714d5e5a532fc4cd4/ivy/func_wrapper.py#L407>`_
wrapping as a decorator directly to the function :code:`ivy.cross_entropy`?

In this case, the :code:`ivy.cross_entropy` function would itself be called
multiple times, on each of the leaves of the container.
The functions :code:`ivy.clip`, :code:`ivy.log`, :code:`ivy.sum`
and :code:`ivy.negative` would each only consume and return arrays,
and debugging the :code:`ivy.cross_entropy` function
would then become less intuitively chronological,
with each leaf of the input container now processed sequentially,
rather than concurrently.

Therefore, our approach is to **not** wrap any compositional functions which are
already *implicitly nestable* as a result of the *nestable* functions called internally.

There may be some compositional functions which are not implicitly nestable for some
reason, and in such cases adding the explicit
`handle_nestable <https://github.com/unifyai/ivy/blob/5f58c087906a797b5cb5603714d5e5a532fc4cd4/ivy/func_wrapper.py#L407>`_
wrapping may be necessary. But we should try to avoid this,
in order to make the flow of computation as intuitive to the user as possible.

When compiling the code, the computation graph is **identical** in either case,
and there will be no implications on performance whatsoever.
The implicit nestable solution may be slightly less efficient in eager mode,
as the leaves of the container are traversed multiple times rather than once,
but if performance is of concern then the code should always be compiled in any case.
The distinction is only really relevant when stepping through and debugging with eager
mode execution, and for the reasons outlined above, the preference is to keep
compositional implicitly nestable where possible.

**Round Up**

This should have hopefully given you a good feel for containers, and how these are handled in Ivy.

If you're ever unsure of how best to proceed,
please feel free to engage with the `containers discussion`_,
or reach out on `discord`_ in the `containers channel`_!
