Ivy as a Framework
==================

On the :ref:`Building Blocks` page, we explored the role of the backend functional APIs, the Ivy functional API, the framework handler and the graph compiler. These are parts are labelled as (a) in the image below.

On the :ref:`Ivy as a Transpiler` page, we explained the role of the backend-specific frontends in Ivy, and how these enable automatic code conversions between different ML frameworks. This part is labelled as (b) in the image below.

So far, by considering parts (a) and (b), we have mainly treated Ivy as a fully functional framework with code conversion abilities. Ivy builds on these primitives to create a fully-fledged ML framework with stateful classes, optimizers and convenience tools to get ML experiments running in very few lines of code.

Specifically, here we consider the :code:`ivy.Container` class, the :code:`ivy.Array` class and the stateful API. These parts are labelled as (c) in the image below.

Some tools described here are works in progress, as indicated by the the construction signs ðŸš§. This is in keeping with the rest of the documentation.

| (a) :ref:`Ivy Container` âœ…
| Hierarchical container solving almost everything behind the scenes in Ivy
|
| (b) :ref:`Ivy Stateful API` âœ…
| Trainable Layers, Modules, Optimizers and more built on the functional API and the Ivy Container
|
| (c) :ref:`Ivy Array` ðŸš§
| Bringing methods as array attributes to Ivy, cleaning up and simplifying code
